## Should I use %{} or #{} for formatting?
You will almost always use #{} to format your strings, but there are times when you want to apply the same format to multiple values. That's when %{} comes in handy.

## Quote 
```puts %q{
There's something going on here.
With this weird quote
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
```

## Newline character
the characters \n (backslash n) between the names of the months. These two characters put a new line character into the string at that point.

## Backlash

Lets you escape the symbols, like in JS
